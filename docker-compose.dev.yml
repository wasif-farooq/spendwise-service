  # In dev mode, we might want to run services locally but keep infra in docker
  # Or run services in docker with binding.
  # For now, let's assume we run services on host via nodemon/ts-node as per package.json scripts
  # So this file might just be overrides if needed.
  
  # Example: Exposing ports that might not be exposed in prod
